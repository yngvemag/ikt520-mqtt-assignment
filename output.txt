==== IKT520 MQTT Assignment Solution ====
Make sure an MQTT broker is running at localhost:1883
(e.g., using: docker run -d --name emqx -p 18083:18083 -p 1883:1883 emqx/emqx)

Persistent subscriber received: 'Temperature reading 18' on 'Sensor/Temp'
Persistent subscriber received: 'Temperature reading 19' on 'Sensor/Temp'
Persistent subscriber received: 'Temperature reading 20' on 'Sensor/Temp'

Received 20 messages after reconnection
Observation: The subscriber received all messages published while it was disconnected.
Explanation:
  - clean_session=False creates a persistent session
  - QoS 1 ensures messages are stored for offline clients
  - When client reconnects with same ID, broker delivers stored messages

--- Task 7: Non-Persistent Session (QoS 1) ---

  subscriber = mqtt.Client(
Non-persistent subscriber connected, rc=0, session present=False
Subscribed to Sensor/Temp with QoS 1

Received 0 messages after reconnection
Observation: The subscriber did NOT receive any messages published while it was disconnected.
Explanation:
  - clean_session=True creates a new session each time
  - All subscriptions and pending messages are deleted when client disconnects
  - QoS 1 guarantees delivery only for active sessions

Subscriber received: 'Temperature reading 18' on 'Sensor/Temp'
Subscriber received: 'Temperature reading 19' on 'Sensor/Temp'
Subscriber received: 'Temperature reading 20' on 'Sensor/Temp'

Received 20 messages after reconnection
Observation: The subscriber did NOT receive any messages published while it was disconnected.
Explanation:
  - Despite using clean_session=False (persistent session)
  - QoS 0 subscription doesn't support message storage
  - The subscription QoS level (0) determines storage behavior
  - Even though messages were published with QoS 2, they weren't stored
